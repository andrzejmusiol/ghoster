# Ghoster - Anonymous P2P Terminal Chat

Ghoster is a command-line interface (CLI) application that enables completely anonymous, peer-to-peer (P2P) chat directly from your terminal. It's designed for users who prioritize privacy and want to communicate without relying on centralized servers or revealing their identity.

## Features

*   **100% Anonymous:** No registration, no user accounts, no identifiable information collected.
*   **Peer-to-Peer:** Direct communication between users, bypassing central servers.
*   **Terminal-Based:** Lightweight and efficient, perfect for quick and secure conversations.
*   **End-to-End Encryption (Planned):** Future versions will incorporate robust encryption to secure all communications.
*   **Simple GUI for browsers (Planned):**
*   **Simple Terminal Interface:** Easy to use, even for those new to CLI applications.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

Ghoster leverages a decentralized network (e.g., a DHT or a simple rendezvous server for initial connection) to establish direct connections between peers. Once connected, messages are exchanged directly between the participants. The anonymity is maintained by not requiring any personal information and by potentially routing traffic through multiple nodes (future feature) to obscure the origin.
